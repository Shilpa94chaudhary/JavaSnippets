# Part 1: Basic Java Programs

Welcome to Part 1 of your Java programming journey! This folder contains a set of basic Java programs to help us practice fundamental concepts such as variables, loops, conditions, and input/output. These programs are designed to provide hands-on experience and reinforce our understanding of essential Java concepts.
